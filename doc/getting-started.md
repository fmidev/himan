# Getting started

Recommended way of using Himan is via the provided docker images (quay.io/fmi/himan). See also [using Docker images](#Using_Docker_images).

In operative environments Himan relies heavily on a database that is providing all data and metadata. This database schema is provided here: https://github.com/fmidev/radon.

Example: running seaicing plugin for Hirlam data. Seaicing plugin calculates an index that describes the amount of ice that is built up on a ship's superstructure. Files for this example are located at example/seaicing.

## Define a json configuration

```
{
        "bbox" : "5,45,30,65",
        "scanning_mode" : "+x+y",
        "ni" : "150",
        "nj" : "150",
        "source_producer" : "999999",
        "target_producer" : "999999",
        "hours" : "3",
        "origintime" : "2017-04-05 00:00:00",
        "file_write" : "multiple",

        "processqueue" : [
        {
                "leveltype" : "height",
                "levels" : "0",
                "plugins" : [ { "name" : "seaicing" } ]
        }
        ]
}
```

Breaking the configuration into pieces:

```
        "bbox" : "5,45,30,65",
        "scanning_mode" : "+x+y",
        "ni" : "150",
        "nj" : "150",
```

The target area for the calculation has lower-left longitude 5 degrees and latitude 10 degrees. The corresponding top-right coordinates are 30,65. Scanning mode for this grid is +x+y, which means that reading starts from the bottom left corner and goes right and up. The grid for this area has size 150x150 grid points. Source area does not need to be defined: Himan will determine it from the source file and will interpolate all data to target area and grid. Himan supports a few of the most common projections used in the meteorological domain. In operational environments it might be prudent (and faster!) to produce the data in the same grid as the source data.


```
        "source_producer" : "999999",
        "target_producer" : "999999",
```

Both source and target producer id are 999999. This corresponds to missing value: because the example is run using no-database mode, Himan is not able to fetch the real producer ids.

```
        "hours" : "3",
        "origintime" : "2017-04-05 00:00:00",
```

The analysis time (or origin time) for the forecast is 5th of April, 2017 00z. The calculation is done for forecast hour (leadtime) 3, i.e. valid time is 2017-04-05 03:00:00.

```
        "file_write" : "multiple",

```

Output data is written so that each field is written to a separate file. In the context of this example this does not really matter because the calculation outputs only one field. The default output file type is Grib.

```

        "processqueue" : [
        {
                "leveltype" : "height",
                "levels" : "0",
                "plugins" : [ { "name" : "seaicing" } ]
        }
        ]
```

The processqueue (list of plugins that are executed) consists only one plugin: seaicing. The resulting data is written to leveltype height/0.

## Run Himan

```
$ wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fmidev/himan/master/example/seaicing/seaicing.json \
       https://github.com/fmidev/himan/raw/master/example/seaicing/seaicing.grib

$ himan -f seaicing.json seaicing.grib

Note that seaicing plugin does not separate land points from sea points: the index is mostly zero due to warm conditions on the baltic sea.
